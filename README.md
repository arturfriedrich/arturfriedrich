Hi, I'm Artúr. I'm a full stack software developer based in Budapest, Hungary.

I work at EcoSim, where I primarily use PHP, Vue.js, React.js, and TypeScript. I hold a computer science engineering degree from Széchenyi István University, and I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in business informatics.

In my free time, I enjoy working on home projects with microcontrollers and customizing my Linux setup. Outside of tech, I like road cycling, watching Formula 1, and building LEGO sets.
